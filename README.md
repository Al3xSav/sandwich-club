<h1>Sandwich Club for Nanodegree Advanced</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
In this project, you will complete the Sandwich Club app to show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

<h2>Why this Project</h2>
Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project will help you to better understand how it is processed.

<h2>What Will I Learn?</h2>
Through this project, you will:

<ul>
<li>Learn how to submit projects for review</li>
<li>Practice JSON parsing to a model object</li>
<li>Design an activity layout</li>
<li>Populate all fields in the layout accordingly</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Do I Complete this Project?</h2>
Download the <a href=https://github.com/udacity/sandwich-club-starter-code"" target="_blank">Sandwich Club app starter code</a>.

Design the layout for the detail activity so the different elements display in a sensible way. Implement the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI that you designed.
